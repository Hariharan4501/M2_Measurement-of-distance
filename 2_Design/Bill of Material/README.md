## SOFTWARE :-

#### 1] SimulIDE:
      - SimulIDE provides AVR, Arduino and PIC microcontrollers that can be accessed just like other components. 
      - Features like gpsim and simavr allow you to use PIC and AVR microcontrollers, respectively.
      - Editor/Debugger is still in its firsts stages of development, with basic functionalities, but it is possible to write, compile and perform basic debugging with
          breakpoints, watch registers and global variables.

      
#### 2] AVR:
      - An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is an electronic device that maintains a constant voltage level to electrical equipment on the same load.
      - The AVR regulates voltage variations to deliver constant, reliable power supply.
      - Features:
        i] SENSING INPUT. Voltage.
        ii] POWER INPUT (PMG) Voltage.
        iii] REGULATION. +/- 1% (see note 1)
